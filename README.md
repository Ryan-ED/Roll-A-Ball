# Welcome to Ryan's Roll A Ball !

### This game was made by following the step by step instructions from the video tutorials on the [Unity website](https://unity3d.com/)
> You can find those videos (and many other tutorials) [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial)

## P.S. 
This is the first game I have ever made. I am a college student majoring in C#. Total noob. This was a fun exercise and I definitely plan on working on it more!
